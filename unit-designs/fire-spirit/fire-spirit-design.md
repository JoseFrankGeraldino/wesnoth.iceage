## Special Mechanics

### Terrain Interaction
- Fire Spirits interact favorably with volcanic/mountain terrain
- Can "charge" on lava tiles for enhanced abilities
- Spreadable fire affects grass and wooden structures

### Weakness
- Water-based attacks deal double damage
- Ice terrain slows movement and reduces damage output
- Wet environments reduce fire spread effectiveness

- Secondary: Dark Red (#8B0000), Light Orange (#FFA500)
- Glow: Intense white-gold gradient

### Animation States
- Idle: Gentle floating flame with pulsing glow
- Attack: Explosive burst with trailing particles
- Hit: Flare-up effect with temporary brightness increase
- Death: Dispersal animation with fading embers

## Balance Notes
- High damage output balanced by water weakness
- Ranged capabilities offset by moderate HP
