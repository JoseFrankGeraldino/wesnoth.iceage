# Yeti Line Design - Ice Dwellers/Neutral

Each progression level represents a Yeti growing older, larger, and more formidable.

## 🎨 **Visual Design Guidelines**

### **Color Palette**
- **Primary**: Gray-brown fur with white/silver tips (aging effect)
- **Secondary**: Ice-blue eyes and crystalline ice patches on fur
- **Accents**: Snow white mane/hair, glacier blue coloring on extremities
- **Yeti Size Progression**: Young (8-10 ft) → Adult (12-14 ft) → Elder (15-17 ft) → Ancient (18-20+ ft)

### **Fur & Appearance Progression**
- **Level 1 (Young Yeti)**: Brown-gray fur, compact muscular build, minimal scarring, bright eyes
- **Level 2 (Adult Yeti)**: Darker brown, silver highlights appearing, more muscular definition, first scars visible
- **Level 3 (Elder Yeti)**: Predominantly silver/white fur with gray patches, extensive scarring, weathered appearance, icy aura
- **Level 4 (Ancient Yeti)**: Nearly white fur with frost patterns, deep blue eyes, massive scars, emanates cold mist, crystalline ice formations on shoulders/back

### **Physical Features**
- **Level 1**: Ape-like posture, powerful arms, ground-dwelling stance
- **Level 2**: Slightly more upright, broader shoulders, more intimidating presence
- **Level 3**: Hunched elder stance, walking stick/club made of ancient bone, aura of power
- **Level 4**: Towering over all creatures, barely upright, surrounded by swirling snow/ice, mythical presence

### **Animation States**
- **Idle**: Breathing heavily, occasionally snorting, scanning surroundings
- **Moving**: Powerful strides, leaving footprints/frost trails, deliberate movement
- **Attacking**: Furious fist strikes, ground-shaking impact, follow-through animations
- **Defending**: Bracing for impact, tucking into defensive posture
- **Dying**: Slow collapse, roar of defiance, leaving crater in snow

## ⚔️ **Combat Mechanics**

### **Tactical Positioning**
Yetis excel in:
- **Superior in**: Mountain terrain, frozen terrain, glaciers, high altitude battlefields
- **Good in**: Flat terrain, forest
- **Disadvantaged in**: Water-heavy terrain, swamps, desert (weakened by heat)
- **Useless in**: Lava terrain, deep water (cannot reach)

### **Team Synergies**
- **With Ice Dwellers**: Perfect faction unit - benefits from cold terrain buffs
- **With Walrus Riders**: Complementary aquatic/mountain control
- **With Darkness Spirits**: Void magic enhances ancient presence
- **Against Fire Spirits**: Natural opposition but resistant fire damage helps
- **Against Desert Units**: Disadvantaged in non-frozen terrain

### **Counters**
- **Strong Against**: Heavy cavalry, melee units, siege units (raw strength)
- **Weak To**: Fire-based attacks (80% resistance, not immunity), extreme heat terrain
- **Natural Enemy**: Fire spirits, sun-aligned units, heat-based magic
- **Vulnerability**: Ranged specialists can kite Yeti's melee range

### **Special Interactions**
- **Mountain Mastery**: Movement bonuses in mountains offset slow base movement
- **Knockback Mechanics**: Grapple and Roar provide tactical positioning opportunities
- **Simple-Mind Advantage**: Cannot be fooled by tricks, decoys, or psychological warfare
- **Slow but Inevitable**: Yeti pursues relentlessly without distraction

- HP increases dramatically showing growing durability (54→142 = +163%)
- Damage scales with experience and level

## 🌍 **Lore & Background**

### **Cultural Origins**
Yetis are solitary creatures of legend, dwelling in the highest, coldest mountain peaks where few humans venture. Their origin is mysterious—some believe they are remnants of an ancient race, others think them natural evolution of ape-kind adapted to extreme cold. They possess an undeniable intelligence despite their simple behavior, as if their minds work on a different level than humanoids.

### **Life Cycle**
- **Young Yeti (Level 1)**: Recently reached adult size, establishing territory in remote mountains
- **Adult Yeti (Level 2)**: Peak physical condition, successful hunter and territorial defender
- **Elder Yeti (Level 3)**: Centuries old, scarred from countless battles, possesses ancient wisdom
- **Ancient Yeti (Level 4)**: Legendary being of myth and legend, possibly thousands of years old

### **Combat Philosophy**
"What thinks does not need words. What kills with bare hands requires no weapons. What lives in frozen peaks fears no winter." - Unknown Scout's Journal

Yetis embody pure, primal force. They do not strategize like humanoids; they simply ARE—unstoppable, inevitable, and terrifyingly patient. An encounter with a Yeti often ends one of two ways: survival with a good story, or not surviving at all.

### **Relationship with Other Units**
- **Respect**: Walrus Riders recognize Yeti as aquatic equivalent—both masters of environment
- **Indifference**: Frost Clans units find Yetis mysterious but respect their power
- **Fear**: Most other factions treat Yeti encounters as disasters requiring entire armies
- **Spirits**: Elemental spirits view Yetis as ancient echoes of primal times

### **Notable Encounters**
Legend speaks of several famous Yetis:
- **The White Mountain Sentinel**: An Ancient Yeti that protected a mountain pass for 200 years
- **The Howling Twins**: Two Elder Yetis that roamed together in the Frozen Wastes
- **Old Scarback**: A particularly aggressive Adult Yeti known for attacking settlements

## 🔧 **Implementation Notes**

### **Unit Tree Classification**
- Primary Line: Young Yeti → Adult Yeti → Elder Yeti → Ancient Yeti
- Classification: Monster (Creature Unit)
- Faction: Ice Dwellers (Primary), Neutral (Rare spawns)
- Rarity: Ultra-rare, legendary status

### **Suggested Campaign Roles**
- **Scenario 1**: Yeti appears as environmental hazard players must avoid or defeat
- **Scenario 2**: Players discover Yeti territory and must negotiate or fight
- **Scenario 3**: Ancient Yeti serves as final boss of Ice Dwellers campaign
- **Scenario 4**: Mountain exploration where Yeti is reward for reaching peak

### **Multiplayer Viability**
- **Strength**: Extremely high durability, excellent in mountain maps, psychological impact
- **Weakness**: Slow movement on flat terrain, vulnerable to kiting, single-target
- **Recommended Map Types**: Mountain-heavy, glacier maps, high-altitude scenarios
- **Counter Strategy**: Use ranged specialists, avoid melee engagement, use heat-based attacks

### **Balancing Considerations**
If unit feels overpowered:
- Reduce movement speed (5→4 MP)
- Reduce HP at later tiers
- Increase fire vulnerability (80%→70% resistance)
- Reduce knockback distance (3→2 hexes at max)
- Increase experience requirements

If unit feels underpowered:
- Reduce cost (38→30 gold at Level 1)
- Increase base HP
- Enhance mountain terrain bonuses
- Increase damage output
- Reduce experience requirements for advancement
