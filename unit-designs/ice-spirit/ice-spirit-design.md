## Special Mechanics

### Terrain Interaction
- Ice Spirits thrive on snow and winter terrain
- Can "charge" on frozen lakes and glaciers
- Create impassable ice terrain with certain abilities

### Advantage Systems
- Strong against fire-based units (naturally opposing element)
- Gains defensive bonuses in cold climates
- Crowd control abilities lock down enemies effectively

### Weakness
- Fire attacks deal double damage
- Reduced effectiveness in warm/volcanic terrain
- Lower damage output compared to fire spirits but better crowd control

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Color Palette
- Primary: Pale Blue (#ADD8E6), Cyan (#00FFFF)
- Secondary: White (#FFFFFF), Dark Blue (#00008B)
- Glow: Cool white-blue gradient with aurora effects

### Animation States
- Idle: Gentle crystalline rotation with soft glow
- Attack: Sudden bright flash followed by freezing effect
- Hit: Crack formation across crystal surface
- Death: Shattering animation with dispersing ice shards

## Combat Role

### Strengths
- Excellent crowd control with freeze mechanics
- Defensive positioning with reduced incoming damage
- Strong against fire-element enemies

### Strategic Positioning

## Balance Notes
- Moderate damage offset by crowd control abilities
- Defensive stats balanced by lower mobility
- Crowd control limited by enemy resistance mechanics
- Complements fire units as opposing elemental force
- Creates interesting strategic depth through counter-play
