# Walrus Rider Line Design - Arctic Nomads

## 🦭 **Walrus Rider → Tusked Corsair → Leviathan Warden**

### **Concept Overview**
The Walrus Rider represents the mastery of coastal and aquatic warfare developed by the seafaring clans of the frozen north. These warriors bond with the mighty walruses of arctic waters, creating amphibious mounted units capable of devastating both sea and land combat. Unlike bear-mounted units that excel on tundra, walrus riders thrive in water-adjacent terrain and bring unique aquatic combat advantages.

**Faction Affiliation**: Frost Clans (Coastal Communities), Wanderers (Arctic Explorers)
**Combat Role**: Heavy Amphibious Cavalry, Water Combat Specialist
**Tactical Niche**: Bridge between land and sea operations; strong in shallow water and coastal zones

## 🎨 **Visual Design Guidelines**

### **Color Palette**
- **Primary**: Deep gray and charcoal (walrus hide)
- **Secondary**: Ivory/pearl white (tusks and highlights)
- **Accents**: Arctic blue and silver (tribal markings and armor)
- **Walrus**: Graduates from young and nimble appearance (Level 1) to massive, scarred veteran (Level 3)

### **Armor Progression**
- **Level 1 (Walrus Rider)**: Leather harness, basic bone/ivory ornaments, simple spear
- **Level 2 (Tusked Corsair)**: Reinforced armor with scale patterns (resembling walrus hide), bone-worked harpoon, tribal tattoos visible
- **Level 3 (Leviathan Warden)**: Heavy plate armor worked with deep-sea patterns, magnificent barbed spear of ancient design, elaborate facial tattoos of an elder warrior

### **Mount Appearance**
- **Level 1**: Young, energetic walrus (10-12 ft), brown-gray coloring, small tusks
- **Level 2**: Adult walrus (13-15 ft), darker coloring with scarring patterns, impressive tusks with scratches and battle marks
- **Level 3**: Ancient leviathan walrus (16+ ft), pale gray with white patches, massive tusks with ritual etchings, aquatic parasites (symbolic of age)

### **Animation States**
- **Idle**: Walrus shifts weight, occasionally snorts; rider adjusts harness
- **Moving**: Walrus moves with powerful flippers, splashing through water
- **Attacking**: Walrus rears/charges with tusks leading; rider leans into the attack with weapon raised
- **Defending**: Walrus lowers head protectively; rider braces behind tusks
- **Dying**: Slow, dignified collapse into water or snow

## ⚔️ **Combat Mechanics**

### **Tactical Positioning**
Walrus Riders excel in coastal and river-based campaigns:
- **Superior in**: Shallow water, beaches, coastal villages, river crossings
- **Good in**: Any water-adjacent terrain
- **Disadvantaged in**: Mountains, deep forests (limited maneuverability)
- **Useless in**: Deserts, high mountains, lava terrain

### **Team Synergies**
- **With Pack Riders**: Excellent combined aquatic/land harassment tactics
- **With Iceborn Warriors**: Complementary ranged/melee support in mixed squads
- **With Tundra Scouts**: Water-based reconnaissance and patrol support
- **Against Fire Spirits**: Water-based units counter fire effectively (+20% damage vs Fire Spirits)
- **Against Darkness Spirits**: Neutral matchup; light-based terrain advantages help (+10% damage in lit areas)

### **Counters**
- **Strong Against**: Fire-based units, land-locked heavy cavalry, units with fire attacks
- **Weak To**: High-mobility mounted units on land (Pack Riders), ranged attackers in mountains, extreme heat terrain
- **Natural Enemy**: Lava-terrain units, desert-adapted fighters, air-based flyers (cannot reach)

### **Special Interactions**
- **Water Regeneration**: Healing doubled in water terrain; halved in desert/lava
- **Amphibious Advantage**: Can mount surprise attacks from water without movement penalty
- **Tusking Mechanics**: Knockback effects provide unique tactical positioning opportunities

## 📈 **Progression & Balance Notes**

### **Cost-to-Performance Ratio**
| Level | Cost | HP | Damage/Turn | Movement | Role |
|-------|------|----|----|-----------|------|
| Walrus Rider | 24g | 45 | ~35 | 5 | Entry amphibious |
| Tusked Corsair | 48g | 62 | ~52 | 5 | Mid-tier specialist |
| Leviathan Warden | 75g | 80 | ~75 | 6 | Elite commander |

**Balance Assessment**: 
- Cost scales appropriately with each tier (+100% per advancement)
- HP increases provide survivability (45→62→80 = ~42% progression)
- Movement bonuses reward final tier (+1 MP at Level 3)
- Damage output scales consistently with unit progression

### **Experience Requirements**
- Level 1→2: 65 experience (standard)
- Level 2→3: 150 experience (challenging, encourages unit preservation)
- Level 3→4: 200 experience (theoretical maximum, rare achievement)

### **Difficulty Curve**
- **Early Game**: Walrus Rider useful for coastal raids and water crossing control
- **Mid Game**: Tusked Corsair becomes primary amphibious threat; excellent for harassment
- **Late Game**: Leviathan Warden serves as anchor unit for water-based armies; devastating in aquatic battles

## 🌊 **Lore & Background**

### **Cultural Origins**
Walrus Riders emerge from the Arctic coastal communities of the Frost Clans - seafarers who adapted to the harsh marine environment. Unlike their land-bound cousins who ride bears, these warriors discovered the mutual benefits of bonding with walruses, massive pinnipeds capable of traversing both ice floes and deep waters.

The ritual of bonding with a walrus is sacred and rare. Young warriors seeking this path must survive a winter alone on an arctic island, proving their worthiness. If a walrus accepts them, the partnership begins - a lifelong bond between human and beast.

### **Combat Philosophy**
"Strike from the waters where enemies cannot follow, retreat to the depths where they dare not venture." - Old Arctic Saying

Walrus Riders embody amphibious warfare doctrine. Their strength lies not in overwhelming land-based armies but in controlling water routes, executing coordinated riverine assaults, and commanding respect in battles where water provides tactical advantage.

### **Relationship with Other Units**
- **Bear Riders**: Cousins in combat, rival faction of same clan. Mutual respect and occasional conflict over territory.
- **Pack Riders**: Natural allies in coordinated warfare; bears and packs create land-control while walruses control waters.
- **Iceborn Warriors**: Complementary expertise; warriors handle close combat while riders manage mobility and positioning.
- **Spirits**: Mysterious forces; riders respect spirits' power and avoid direct confrontation with Fire or Ice spirits.

### **Notable Warriors**
Several legendary Leviathan Wardens are recorded in Ice Age history:
- **Korjak the Wave-Breaker**: Led the Great Coastal Defense, holding enemy fleets at bay for an entire season
- **Thalas the Ancient**: Reputedly 80+ years old when finally falling in battle; his walrus lived even longer
- **Nimirah of the Silver Tusks**: First female Leviathan Warden; pioneered deep-water stealth tactics

## 🔧 **Implementation Notes**

### **Unit Tree Classification**
- Primary Line: Walrus Rider → Tusked Corsair → Leviathan Warden
- Classification: Heavy Cavalry (Amphibious Variant)
- Faction Requirement: Frost Clans primary, available to other factions as rare recruit

### **Suggested Campaign Roles**
- **Scenario 1**: Coastal defense against sea-based invaders
- **Scenario 2**: River crossing operations and amphibious assault
- **Scenario 3**: Multi-faction naval warfare with land components
- **Scenario 4**: Deep-sea exploration and dungeon infiltration via water

### **Multiplayer Viability**
- **Strength**: Unique niche (water dominance unavailable elsewhere)
- **Weakness**: Limited terrain availability reduces strategic flexibility
- **Recommended Map Types**: Island-heavy, river-based, coastal, lagoon-heavy maps
- **Counter Strategy**: Force engagements on land; use elevation to prevent water-based advantage

### **Balancing Considerations**
If unit feels overpowered:
- Reduce movement speed in water (5→4 MP)
- Reduce regeneration (3→2 HP/turn in water)
- Increase fire damage vulnerability (70%→60% resistance)
- Reduce command radius (2→1 hex for Leviathan Warden)

If unit feels underpowered:
- Increase base cost reduction (24→20 gold) for early recruitment
- Enhance defense bonuses in water
- Add immunity to water-based terrain hazards
- Increase bleeding damage on Tusked Corsair
