# Ice Age Game Extensions

## 🌅 **Custom Alignment System**

The Ice Age expansion introduces new alignment types that reflect the unique nature of winter magic and the balance between eternal ice and the cycles of light.

### **🌆 Twilight Alignment**
**Philosophy**: Creatures of balance, transition, and in-between states  
**Combat Bonus**: +25% damage during dawn and dusk turns  
**Combat Penalty**: -25% damage during midday and midnight turns  
**Thematic Concept**: Units that draw power from liminal moments, transitions, and balance

**Typical Units**:
- Ice shamans who commune with spirits during twilight rituals
- Creatures that exist between ice and fire, life and death  
- Units with abilities that change based on time of day
- Diplomatic/support units that excel during "neutral" times

### **⚡ Solaris-Noctis Alignment**
**Philosophy**: Creatures of elemental extremes, embodying both scorching fire and freezing darkness  
**Combat Bonus**: +25% damage during midday and midnight turns (peak power moments)  
**Combat Penalty**: -25% damage during dawn and dusk turns (transition weakness)  
**Thematic Concept**: Beings of absolute extremes who thrive at the most intense moments of day and night, but falter during balanced transition times

**Typical Units**:
- Pure fire elementals and deep ice wraiths
- Creatures that embody absolute hot or cold
- Units with extreme magical powers that need peak energy times
- Beings that cannot exist in balanced, temperate conditions
- Fire-ice hybrids that shift between extreme states
