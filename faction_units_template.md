## Notes for Ice Factions

**Consider these ice-themed mechanics:**
- **Freeze attacks:** Slows enemy movement/attacks
- **Ice shield:** Temporary damage resistance
- **Blizzard summoning:** Area effect abilities
- **Cold resistance:** High resistance to cold/pierce, weakness to fire
- **Ice terrain creation:** Ability to create temporary ice terrain
- **Hibernate:** Healing ability that requires skipping a turn
- **Frostbite:** Damage over time effect

**Terrain considerations:**
- Excellent performance on snow/ice
- Good performance on mountains/tundra  
- Poor performance in desert/swamp
- Unique interaction with frozen water tiles

**Strategic themes:**
- **Faction 1:** Defensive, fortification-focused, shamanic magic
- **Faction 2:** Aggressive, beast-mastery, primal ice magic
